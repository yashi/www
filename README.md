## 📰 Add a News Article
1. Create a new file in `content/news/`
2. Name it by date. ex) `2025-06-01.md` and `2025-06-01.en.md`
3. Add title (string) variable to front matter.
4. Add link variable under [extra] if article has external link.
5. Add your news.

   ```
   +++
   title = "「JAXAベンチャー」の認定"

   [extra]
   link = "https://aerospacebiz.jaxa.jp/venture/"
   +++

   Content here...
   ```

If you need a line break, do not use two trailing spaces at the end of
a line, because they are very hard to notice and, as programmers, we
are not used to writing any trailing whitespace. Please use an
explicit `<br>` tag for line breaks.

    ```
    These lines<br>
    should be two lines.
    ```

On news pages, we use an `<h1>` tag outside the article, so the news
title itself is an `<h2>`. This means you should only use level-3 or
lower headers within the article. In other words, start from `###` or
deeper for your section headings.

### Linking to Local Pages

A link to a local page must include the `@/` prefix.

In your `.md` file, create a link like this:

```
[here](@/products/scobc_a1.md)
```

Or, if you are calling one of our shortcodes:

```
{% hero_element(
    title = "PRODUCTS",
    link = "@/products/_index.md",
    link_text = "Details"
) %}
```

This ensures the correct link is generated for the page, based on its
language.

## 💻 Add a New Job Position
1. Create a new file in `content/recruit/`.
   - If you are posting in Japanese, end the file name with `.md`.
   - If you are posting in English, end the file name with `.en.md`.
2. The file name can be anything, unlike news articles.
3. Add a title in the front matter. The title will appear on the job card.
4. Add `active = true` under the `[extra]` section.
5. Add the job description.

   ```
   +++
   title = "Software Engineer"

   [extra]
   active = true
   +++

   Content here...
   ```

Note that since the job page uses "RECRUIT" as the H1 and the job
title as H2, job description files should only use H3:(`###`) or
smaller for section headings.
